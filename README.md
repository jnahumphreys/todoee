## What is Todoee?

**Todoee** is a lightweight, self-hostable task manager built for technical users who value simplicity, speed, and full data ownership. Designed as a PWA with local-first storage and no cloud dependencies, Todoee helps you focus on your tasks—without distractions, accounts, or tracking. Easily deployable via Docker, Todoee is ideal for solo developers, makers, and privacy-conscious users.

## What's the current status of Todoee?

Todoee is currently in active development; the initial release will support basic task management—including creating, editing, completing, and deleting tasks—along with a simple self-hosting setup via Docker. We're focused on building a fast, local-first experience with no external dependencies. For a detailed breakdown of what's planned, check out the [MVP Product Requirements Document](docs/PRD.md).
